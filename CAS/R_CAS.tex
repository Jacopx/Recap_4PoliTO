\section{Introduction Computer Design}
\subsection{Computer Evolution}
The first general-purpose computer was created in the late 40s. What now we can buy for 500\$ is equivalent (performance) to what could be bought for about \$1M in 85'.\\
During the years the performance growth was not linear, as you can see in figure , during the first 10 years the annual increase was around 25-30\%/year, from the late 80s to the 2000 the growth is increased around 50\%/year and, in the last few years it decrease to the 22\%. Why this change during the increase?\\

The manufacturers have found a lot of physical problem related to the creation of new products, this problem are mainly related to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Power-Issue.
  \item Lower instruction-level parallelism.
  \item Unchanged memory lantecy.
\end{itemize}
in fact, since 2004, the major industry have changed the conceptual ways to desing processors, switching from single to multi-core architectures. We can say that, in anytime, this growth is incredible an is due to improvements in technology, microprocessor architecture and software development. %Intro @ Pag. 10
